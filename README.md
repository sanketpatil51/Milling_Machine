This study focuses on developing a predictive model for forecasting the success or failure of milling machine operations in manufacturing processes. We utilize logistic regression, random forest, artificial neural networks (ANN), and decision tree algorithms to construct the predictive model. Our analysis includes a comprehensive evaluation using confusion matrices to summarize the performance of each model. By leveraging these advanced analytical techniques, our research aims to provide actionable insights for optimizing milling machine operations and enhancing overall process reliability in manufacturing.

# Introduction
Milling machine operations play a pivotal role in manufacturing processes, where success or failure can significantly impact overall efficiency and reliability. In this study, we address the challenge of predicting the outcomes of milling machine operations using advanced analytical techniques. Specifically, we employ logistic regression, random forest, artificial neural networks (ANN), and decision tree algorithms to develop a predictive model for forecasting success or failure.
